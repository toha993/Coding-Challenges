# Coding Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to the challenges from [codingchallenges.fyi](https://codingchallenges.fyi/). Each subdirectory is a separate challenge implementation.

## Challenges Completed

1. [wc tool](/ccwc) - A clone of the Unix word count tool

   - Counts bytes, words, lines and characters in text files
   - [Original Challenge](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-wc)

2. [JSON Parser](/json-parser) - A JSON parser implementation
   - Parses and validates JSON according to specification
   - Supports all JSON data types and nested structures
